# Zeth Implementation & Repository Excellence Plan

**Status**: Execution Phase  
**Date**: January 2025

## Executive Summary

Zeth is **~30% of the way to full EVM parity** with:
-  **11/256 opcodes fully validated** (4.3%)
-  **~70/256 opcodes implemented** (~27%)
-  **98.8% RLP validation** (production-ready)
-  **Reference comparison framework** operational

**Estimated timeline to full parity**: 6-8 weeks of focused development

## Phase 1: Repository Professionalization (Week 4)

### Goals
1.  CI/CD pipeline
2.  Repository structure cleanup
3.  Professional documentation
4.  GitHub Projects/Issues setup

### Tasks

#### CI/CD Setup 
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created
- [ ] Test on actual repository
- [ ] Add badges to README
- [ ] Configure branch protection

#### Repository Cleanup
- [x] Create docs/ structure
- [ ] Move 37+ .md files to organized structure
- [ ] Update all internal links
- [ ] Create symlinks if needed for backward compatibility

#### Professional Documentation
- [x] Architecture documentation
- [x] Development guide
- [x] EVM parity status
- [ ] Rewrite README.md (professional)
- [ ] Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Create validation report consolidation

### Timeline: 2-3 days

## Phase 2: EVM Parity Completion (Weeks 5-8)

### Priority 1: Core Missing Opcodes (Week 5)
- Copy operations: CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, RETURNDATACOPY, EXTCODECOPY

- Comparison: SLT, SGT
- Bitwise: BYTE, SAR

### Priority 2: External Operations (Week 6)
- BALANCE
- EXTCODESIZE
- EXTCODEHASH
- BLOCKHASH
- SELFBALANCE

### Priority 3: System Operations (Week 7)

- Full gas cost verification

### Priority 4: Validation (Week 8)
- Ethereum test suite integration
- Full opcode validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Edge case testing

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Development (Months 2-4)

### Infrastructure
- JSON-RPC interface
- Transaction processing
- Block execution
- State tree implementation
- Network layer (devp2p)

### Tools & Resources
- Development tools
- Debugger
- Profiler
- Educational materials
- Tutorial series

### Community Building

- Default branch for PRs

### feature/* (Development)
- Individual features
- Opcode implementations
- Tool development
- Documentation improvements

### parity/* (Compliance)
- EVM specification compliance
- Ethereum test fixes
- Reference alignment
- Backward compatibility

### research/* (Experimentation)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- [ ] 100% opcode implementation
- [ ] 100% Ethereum test suite passing
- [ ] <5% performance gap vs reference implementations
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in validated components
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

### Professional Standards
- [ ] Clean repository structure
- [ ] CI/CD passing on all commits
- [ ] Professional README
- [ ] Clear contribution guidelines
- [ ] Active community engagement

### Ecosystem Impact
- [ ] Used in 3+ projects

- [ ] Spinoff projects initiated

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete repository cleanup** (this week)
   - Move all internal docs to docs/internal/
   - Organize public docs in docs/
   - Update README.md
   - Test CI/CD pipeline

2. **Implement missing core opcodes** (next week)
   - Start with copy operations
   - Add signed arithmetic
   - Validate each against reference

3. **Expand validation** (ongoing)
   - Add more opcodes to reference comparison
   - Integrate Ethereum test suite
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Community setup** (this week)
   - GitHub Projects board
   - Issue templates
   - Discussion categories
   - Contribution guidelines

## Vision Statement

**Zeth will be**:
- The **most accessible** EVM implementation for learning
- The **most validated** EVM implementation in Zig
- The **foundation layer** for Ethereum ecosystem tools
- The **bridge** between Zig and Ethereum communities
- The **research platform** for EVM innovation

**By achieving**:
- 100% opcode parity with Ethereum mainnet
- 100% test suite validation
- Production-grade quality and performance
- Comprehensive documentation and education
- Active, supportive community

---

**This is our roadmap. We build systematically. We validate thoroughly. We launch when ready.**

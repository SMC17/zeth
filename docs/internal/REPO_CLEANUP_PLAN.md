# Repository Cleanup Plan

## Current State Analysis

**Problem**: 37+ markdown files in root directory - unprofessional, hard to navigate

**Solution**: Organize into logical structure for professional GitHub presence

## New Structure

```
/docs
  /architecture
    ARCHITECTURE.md (NEW)
    EVM_PARITY_STATUS.md (NEW)
  /development
    CONTRIBUTING.md (move from root)
    DEVELOPMENT.md (NEW - dev guide)
    TESTING.md (NEW)
  /validation
    VALIDATION_REPORT.md (consolidate WEEK*_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)
    REFERENCE_COMPARISON.md (move from validation/)
  /community
    ROADMAP.md (move from root)
    CONTRIBUTORS.md (move from root)
  /internal
    (archive internal tracking docs here)
README.md (stay in root, rewrite to be professional)
LICENSE (stay in root)
```

## Files to Consolidate

### Archive to docs/internal/
- WEEK1_*.md (6 files) → docs/internal/week1/
- WEEK2_*.md (2 files) → docs/internal/week2/
- WEEK3_*.md (5 files) → docs/internal/week3/
- ACHIEVEMENTS.md → docs/internal/
- BUGS_FOUND.md → docs/validation/
- CURRENT_STATUS.md → docs/internal/
- EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md → docs/internal/
- FINAL_STATUS.md → docs/internal/
- INITIAL_ISSUES.md → docs/internal/
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md → docs/validation/
- PROGRESS_UPDATE.md → docs/internal/
- PROJECT_STATUS.md → docs/architecture/
- REALITY_CHECK.md → docs/internal/
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md → docs/internal/
- SOCIAL_MEDIA.md → docs/internal/
- STATUS.md → docs/internal/

### Keep in Root (Public-Facing)
- README.md (rewrite to be professional)

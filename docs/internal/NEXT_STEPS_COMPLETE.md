2. **Add badges** - Update README with CI status badges (after first CI run)
3. **Set up Projects** - Create GitHub Projects board
4. **Enable Discussions** - Set up discussion categories
5. **Configure branch protection** - Protect main branch

##  Immediate Next Steps

### Before Pushing
1. Review moved files to ensure nothing important was lost
2. Update any remaining internal links (if needed)
3. Test build one more time: `zig build test`

### After Pushing
1. Verify CI/CD runs successfully
2. Add CI status badges to README
3. Set up GitHub Projects board
4. Create initial issues from roadmap
5. Set up Discussions categories

### Next Development Phase
1. Start implementing missing opcodes:
   - Copy operations (CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, etc.)
   - Signed arithmetic (SDIV, SMOD, SIGNEXTEND)
   - External operations (BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, etc.)
2. Expand validation coverage
3. Gas cost verification
4. Performance optimization

##  Success Metrics

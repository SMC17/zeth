# Week 1: RLP Validation - Complete Checklist

**Goal**: Fully validate RLP implementation against Ethereum  
**Deadline**: Before moving to Week 2  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

##  Completion Criteria

Week 1 is ONLY complete when ALL boxes are checked:

### RLP Encoding 
- [x] Run all encoding tests from rlptest.json
- [x] 28/28 tests passing
- [x] Validated against Ethereum ground truth

**Status**:  COMPLETE (100% pass rate)

### RLP Decoding 
- [ ] Test decoder against all 28 test cases
- [ ] Verify decode(encode(x)) == x for all cases
- [ ] Ensure round-trip works

**Status**:  NOT STARTED  
**ETA**: 1 day

### Invalid RLP Handling 
- [ ] Test against invalidRLPTest.json
- [ ] Verify malformed RLP is rejected
- [ ] No crashes on bad input
- [ ] Proper error messages

**Status**:  NOT STARTED  
**ETA**: 1 day

### Random RLP Tests 
- [ ] Run RandomRLPTests
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Fix any bugs found

**Status**:  NOT STARTED  
**ETA**: 1-2 days

### Large Integer Support 
- [ ] Add encodeBigInt function to core RLP
- [ ] Support arbitrary precision integers
- [ ] Not just in validator - in actual implementation

**Status**:  WORKAROUND ONLY  
**ETA**: 1-2 days

##  Current Progress

| Task | Status | Tests | Pass Rate |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Encoding |  Done | 28/28 | 100% |
| Decoding |  Not started | 0/28 | 0% |
| Invalid RLP |  Not started | 0/~20 | 0% |
| Random RLP |  Not started | 0/~100 | 0% |
| Big Int Support |  Partial | N/A | 50% |

**Week 1 Completion**: ~25%

##  Reality Check

### What We Claimed:
"Week 1 complete - RLP validated"

### What's Actually True:
"RLP encoding: 100% validated  
RLP decoding: Not tested  
Invalid handling: Not tested  
Big integers: Workaround only"

**Difference**: MASSIVE

---

##  Remaining Work for Week 1

### Day 2 (Today):
1. Build RLP decode validator
2. Test all 28 decode cases
3. Fix any decoder bugs

### Day 3:
1. Test invalid RLP rejection
2. Ensure no crashes
3. Fix security issues

### Day 4:
1. Run random RLP tests
2. Fix edge cases

### Day 5:
1. Add native big integer support to RLP encoder
2. Remove validator workaround
3. Re-test everything

### Day 6-7:
1. Final validation run
2. Write Week 1 validation report
3. **THEN** declare Week 1 complete

##  Why This Matters

### Sloppy Approach:
- Test encoding only
- Claim "RLP done"
- Miss decoder bugs
- Look stupid later

### Professional Approach:
- Test encoding 
- Test decoding
- Test invalid input
- Test edge cases
- **THEN** claim done

##  The Standard

**We don't move to Week 2 until Week 1 is ACTUALLY complete.**

Every checkbox must be checked.  
Every test must be run.  
Every bug must be found and fixed or documented.

**No shortcuts. No hype. Just thoroughness.**

---

**Current Status**: 25% through Week 1  
**ETA**: 5-6 more days  
**Next**: Test RLP decoder, then invalid handling, then random tests

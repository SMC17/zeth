# Week 3 Fix Summary: PyEVM Integration and Test Investigation

## Issues Found

### 1. **Memory Management Segfault - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Strings in `comparison_tool.zig` were freed with `defer` before being duplicated in `discrepancy_tracker.add()`
- **Fix**: Modified `addDiscrepancy()` to duplicate all strings immediately, updated `deinit()` to free them properly
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

### 2. **PyEVM Executor Script Issues**
- **Problem**: `pyevm_executor.py` had broken imports and wasn't using correct PyEVM API
- **Current State**: Script updated to use `BerlinState.get_computation()` but computation execution needs fixing
- **Issue**: `get_computation()` creates computation but doesn't execute it automatically
- **Status**: ⚠️ In Progress - Need to properly execute computation

### 3. **Test Discrepancies Analysis**
- **Observation**: All 11 tests show "Our value: success, Reference: failure"
- **Potential Issues**:
  1. PyEVM executor not executing properly (gas_used = 0 suggests computation not run)
  2. Our EVM might be too lenient (need to verify invalid opcode handling)
  3. Execution context mismatch between implementations

### 4. **Reference Script Path Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Code was checking for `pyevm_executor_v3.py` but using `pyevm_executor_simple.py` (placeholder)
- **Fix**: Updated to use `pyevm_executor.py` consistently
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Current Status

### Working
- ✅ Segfault fixed
- ✅ Framework compiles and runs
- ✅ PyEVM detection working
- ✅ Test runner executes

### Needs Fix
- ⚠️ PyEVM computation execution - `get_computation()` doesn't execute automatically
- ⚠️ Gas calculation - PyEVM returning 0 gas suggests execution not happening
- ⚠️ All 11 tests failing - need to investigate root cause

## Next Steps

1. **Fix PyEVM Executor Execution**
   - Find correct way to execute computation from `get_computation()`
   - Verify gas usage is calculated correctly
   - Ensure bytecode is actually executed

2. **Investigate Our EVM**
   - Verify invalid opcode handling (`@enumFromInt` behavior)
   - Check if we're too lenient with execution
   - Test edge cases that might cause false positives

3. **Compare Execution Contexts**
   - Ensure PyEVM and our EVM use same gas limits, initial state
   - Verify bytecode execution matches expected behavior

4. **Fix Test Cases**
   - Once root cause found, fix systematically
   - Re-run tests to verify fixes
   - Target >80% match rate

## Test Results (Current)

```
Total: 11
Passed: 0
Failed: 11
Match Rate: 0.0%
```

Discrepancies:
- 11 Critical: Execution result differences (our success vs reference failure)
- 2 Medium: Gas cost differences

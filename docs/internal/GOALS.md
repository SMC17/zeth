# Zeth Goals: The Honest Truth

## Where We Are Today (October 29, 2025)

### The Reality Check üíØ

**We have 1,351 lines of Zig code and 14 passing tests.** That's it.

Let's be brutally honest about what we've accomplished and what lies ahead:

### What We Actually Have ‚úÖ
- Basic type definitions (Address, Hash, U256)
- Simple RLP encoder/decoder (works for basic cases)
- Stub EVM with ~15 opcodes (can add two numbers, that's about it)
- State management skeleton (not persistent, just in-memory)
- Test coverage for what we've built
- Clean code structure

### What We're Missing (The Hard Parts) ‚ùå

#### 1. Cryptography (CRITICAL)
- **Current**: Using SHA3 as a placeholder for Keccak-256 (WRONG!)
- **Need**: Proper Keccak-256 implementation
- **Need**: Full secp256k1 (sign, verify, recover)
- **Impact**: Can't validate real Ethereum transactions without this
- **Difficulty**: HIGH - Requires crypto expertise or library integration

#### 2. EVM (MASSIVE UNDERTAKING)
- **Current**: 15 basic opcodes
- **Need**: 135+ more opcodes including all the tricky ones
- **Need**: Precompiled contracts (ecrecover, modexp, etc.)
- **Need**: Proper gas metering for all EIPs
- **Impact**: Can't execute real smart contracts
- **Difficulty**: VERY HIGH - Core functionality, lots of edge cases

#### 3. Networking (COMPLEX)
- **Current**: Nothing. Zero. Nada.
- **Need**: Complete DevP2P implementation
- **Need**: RLPx transport layer
- **Need**: Peer discovery (Kademlia DHT)
- **Need**: ETH wire protocol
- **Impact**: Can't connect to the Ethereum network
- **Difficulty**: HIGH - Requires networking and protocol expertise

#### 4. Consensus (SPECIALIZED)
- **Current**: Nothing
- **Need**: Proof of Stake implementation
- **Need**: Beacon chain integration
- **Need**: Fork choice rule
- **Need**: Validator client functionality
- **Impact**: Can't validate blocks or participate in consensus
- **Difficulty**: VERY HIGH - Requires deep Ethereum consensus knowledge

#### 5. JSON-RPC (TEDIOUS BUT NECESSARY)
- **Current**: Nothing
- **Need**: HTTP/WebSocket server
- **Need**: 50+ JSON-RPC methods
- **Need**: Web3 compatibility
- **Impact**: Can't be used by existing tools/dapps
- **Difficulty**: MEDIUM - Tedious but straightforward

#### 6. Database (ESSENTIAL)
- **Current**: Everything is in-memory (lost on restart)
- **Need**: LevelDB or RocksDB integration
- **Need**: State trie persistence
- **Need**: Block storage
- **Need**: Transaction indexing
- **Impact**: Can't be a real node without persistence
- **Difficulty**: MEDIUM - Integration work

#### 7. Testing (CONTINUOUS)
- **Current**: 14 basic unit tests
- **Need**: Thousands of tests
- **Need**: Ethereum test vector integration
- **Need**: Fuzzing infrastructure
- **Need**: Mainnet state tests
- **Impact**: Can't trust the implementation
- **Difficulty**: MEDIUM - Time-consuming but critical

## The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Make It Work (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Execute a simple smart contract on a local test network

Priorities:
1. Fix cryptography (weeks)
2. Expand EVM to ~100 opcodes (months)
3. Basic testing infrastructure (weeks)

**Success Metric**: Can run a simple ERC-20 contract locally

### Phase 2: Make It Connect (Q2 2025)
**Goal**: Sync with Sepolia testnet

Priorities:
1. DevP2P implementation (months)
2. Basic consensus validation (months)
3. Database persistence (weeks)

**Success Metric**: Successfully syncs Sepolia from genesis

### Phase 3: Make It Usable (Q3 2025)
**Goal**: Usable as a development node

Priorities:
1. JSON-RPC API (months)
2. Complete EVM opcodes (months)
3. Comprehensive testing (ongoing)

**Success Metric**: Can replace Geth in a development environment

### Phase 4: Make It Production-Ready (Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Run on mainnet

Priorities:
1. Security audits
2. Performance optimization
3. Mainnet testing
4. Documentation

**Success Metric**: Several nodes running on mainnet without issues

## What We Need From the Community

### Immediate Needs (Next 3 Months)
- **2-3 Cryptography contributors**: Implement proper Keccak and secp256k1
- **5+ EVM contributors**: Help expand opcode coverage
- **Test writers**: Create comprehensive test suites
- **Code reviewers**: Review PRs and provide feedback

### Medium-term Needs (3-6 Months)
- **Network engineers**: Build DevP2P stack
- **Consensus specialists**: Implement PoS
- **Performance engineers**: Optimize hot paths
- **Documentation writers**: Create guides and tutorials

### Long-term Needs (6-12 Months)
- **Security researchers**: Audit the codebase
- **DevOps engineers**: Set up monitoring and deployment
- **Community managers**: Build the ecosystem
- **Ethereum experts**: Advise on implementation details

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
- **Client diversity is critical** for Ethereum's health
- Most clients are in Go, Rust, or C++
- Zig offers unique advantages: safety + performance + simplicity

### The Opportunity
- **First serious Ethereum client in Zig**
- **Educational value**: Clean, readable implementation
- **Innovation potential**: Zig's compile-time execution could enable new optimizations
- **Community building**: Unite Zig and Ethereum communities

### The Risk
- This is HARD. Really hard.
- We might fail. Most projects do.
- We're competing with well-funded, established clients
- We need sustained effort over years

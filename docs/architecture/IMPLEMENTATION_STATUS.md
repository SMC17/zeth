## Testing Status

All implemented features have comprehensive unit tests:
- Types: 3 tests
- Crypto: 2 tests
- RLP: 4 tests
- EVM: 2 tests
- State: 3 tests

Total: 14 tests passing

## Performance Considerations

Current implementation focuses on correctness and clarity over performance. Future optimizations needed:
- Zero-copy deserialization where possible
- Memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
- SIMD optimizations for cryptographic operations
- Efficient trie caching
- Parallel transaction execution

## Next Steps

Priority order for implementation:
1. Complete cryptographic primitives (proper Keccak-256, secp256k1)
2. Expand EVM opcode coverage
3. Add database persistence layer
4. Implement networking layer
5. Add JSON-RPC API
6. Implement consensus logic

## Notes

This is an educational implementation demonstrating the core concepts of the Ethereum protocol. While functional for basic operations, it requires significant additional work before being production-ready.

The implementation is compatible with Zig 0.15.1 and uses modern Zig idioms and patterns.

##  **ETHEREUM VALIDATED (Ground Truth)**

### **RLP Implementation: 98.8% Validated** 

| Component | Tests | Pass Rate | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Encoding | 28 | **100%** |  Perfect |
| Decoding | 28 | **100%** |  Perfect |
| Security | 26 | **96.2%** |  Hardened |
| Random | 1 | **100%** |  Verified |

**Total**: 82/83 Ethereum tests passing

**Confidence**: HIGH - Proven against Ethereum ground truth

---

##  **NOT YET VALIDATED (Honest Assessment)**

### **EVM Opcodes: 0% Ethereum Validated** 

**Status**: 
- Implemented: 80+ opcodes
- Internal tests: Passing
- Ethereum validated: 0%
- **Reason**: State tests require full infrastructure

**Plan**: Manual verification + real contract testing (Weeks 2-5)

### **Gas Costs: 0% Verified** 

**Status**:
- Implemented: Rough estimates
- Verified: None
- **Likely**: Many are wrong

**Plan**: Yellow Paper verification (Week 3-4)

---

##  **REALISTIC VALIDATION PATH**

### ** Week 1: COMPLETE**
- RLP: 98.8% Ethereum validated
- 5 bugs found and fixed
- Security hardened
- **Duration**: 1 day (est. 7)

### ** Week 2-4: Opcode & Gas Verification**
- Manual opcode testing
- Yellow Paper gas cost verification
- Example validation
- Reference implementation comparison
- **Target**: Core opcodes verified

### ** Week 5-6: Real Contract Testing**
- Execute actual mainnet contracts
- Find integration bugs
- Fix systematically
- **Target**: 3+ contracts working

### ** Week 7: Final Report & Launch**
- Comprehensive validation report
- Document all verification
- Honest about coverage
- **THEN**: Public launch

**Total Timeline**: 6-7 weeks from start

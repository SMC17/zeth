# EVM Parity Status

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Goal**: 100% opcode parity with Ethereum mainnet

## Opcode Implementation Status

###  Fully Implemented & Validated (11/256)
- Arithmetic: ADD, MUL, SUB, DIV, MOD, EXP
- Comparison: LT, GT, EQ, ISZERO
- Storage: SLOAD, SSTORE (with EIP-2929 warm/cold)

###  Implemented, Awaiting Validation (~70/256)
- All PUSH operations (PUSH1-PUSH32)
- All DUP operations (DUP1-DUP16)
- All SWAP operations (SWAP1-SWAP16)
- Memory: MLOAD, MSTORE, MSIZE
- Flow: JUMP, JUMPI, JUMPDEST, PC, GAS
- Environmental: ADDRESS, CALLER, CALLVALUE, ORIGIN, CODESIZE, etc.
- Block Info: TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, CHAINID, COINBASE, DIFFICULTY, GASLIMIT, BASEFEE
- Logging: LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3, LOG4
- Bitwise: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHL, SHR
- System: CALL, CREATE, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, STATICCALL, DELEGATECALL, CREATE2

###  Partially Implemented (~5/256)
- CALL, CREATE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL: Basic structure, needs full validation
- EXP: Implemented but gas cost needs verification
- SHA3: Implemented, needs validation

###  Not Yet Implemented (~170/256)
- Signed operations: SDIV, SMOD, SIGNEXTEND
- Comparison: SLT, SGT
- Bitwise: BYTE, SAR
- Copy operations: CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, RETURNDATACOPY, EXTCODECOPY
- External: BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODEHASH
- Block: BLOCKHASH, SELFBALANCE
- Deprecated: CALLCODE
- Precompiles: ECRECOVER, SHA256, RIPEMD160, IDENTITY, MODEXP, BN_ADD, BN_MUL, etc.

## Validation Progress

### Reference Implementation Comparison
- **PyEVM**:  Integrated, 11/11 critical tests passing
- **Geth**:  Setup pending

### Test Coverage
- **Internal Tests**: 66+ tests, 100% passing
- **Ethereum RLP Tests**: 82/83 passing (98.8%)
- **Ethereum EVM Tests**:  Not yet run (requires full infrastructure)
- **Reference Comparison**: 11 critical opcodes validated

## Gas Cost Verification

###  Verified
- Basic arithmetic: ADD (3), MUL (5), DIV (5), MOD (5)
- Comparison: LT (3), GT (3), EQ (3)
- Storage: SLOAD (100 warm / 2100 cold), SSTORE (with EIP-2929)
- Push operations: 3 gas each

###  Needs Verification
- EXP: Complex gas calculation
- Memory expansion costs
- CALL/CREATE operation costs
- All other opcodes

## Priority for Full Parity

### Phase 1: Core Operations (Weeks 1-2) 
-  Basic arithmetic and comparison
-  Stack operations
-  Memory and storage basics
-  Flow control

### Phase 2: Advanced Operations (Weeks 3-4) 
- Copy operations (CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, etc.)
- Signed arithmetic (SDIV, SMOD, SIGNEXTEND)
- External account operations (BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, etc.)
- Block information (BLOCKHASH, SELFBALANCE)

### Phase 3: System Operations (Weeks 5-6)
- CALL/CREATE/CREATE2 full validation
- Precompiles (ECRECOVER, SHA256, etc.)
- Full gas cost verification
- Ethereum test suite integration

### Phase 4: Optimization & Hardening (Week 7+)
- Performance optimization
- Edge case handling
- Security audit
- Production readiness

## Estimated Timeline to Full Parity

- **Current**: ~30% opcode coverage (functional)
- **With validation**: ~15% fully validated
- **Target for v1.0**: 100% opcode parity + validation
- **Estimated timeline**: 6-8 weeks with focused effort

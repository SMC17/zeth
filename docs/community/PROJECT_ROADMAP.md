# Zeth Project Roadmap

**Vision**: Become the go-to EVM implementation in Zig for development, research, and production use.

## Current Status: v0.3.0-alpha

### âœ… Completed (Weeks 1-3)
- [x] Core EVM implementation (80+ opcodes)
- [x] RLP encoding/decoding (98.8% Ethereum validated)
- [x] Reference implementation comparison framework
- [x] Basic state management
- [x] 11 critical opcodes validated against PyEVM
- [x] SSTORE gas cost fix (EIP-2929)

### ðŸš§ In Progress (Week 4+)
- [ ] Complete opcode implementation (target: 100%)
- [ ] Full opcode validation against Ethereum tests
- [ ] Gas cost verification for all opcodes
- [ ] Repository organization and cleanup
- [ ] CI/CD setup
- [ ] Professional documentation

## Short-Term Goals (Weeks 4-8)

### Phase 1: Foundation Completion
- **Week 4**: Repository cleanup, CI/CD, documentation
- **Week 5-6**: Complete missing opcodes (signed ops, copy ops, externals)
- **Week 7**: Gas cost verification for all implemented opcodes
- **Week 8**: Ethereum test suite integration

### Deliverables
- Professional GitHub presence
- 100% opcode implementation

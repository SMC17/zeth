**This document tracks real bugs found by testing against Ethereum.**

##  Critical Bugs

### Bug #1: RLP Decoder Panics on Nested Lists
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Found**: October 29, 2025  
**Location**: `src/rlp/rlp.zig:179`  
**Code**:
```zig
.list => |_| @panic("TODO: calculate list size"),
```

**Impact**:  
- Decoder CRASHES on any nested list structure
- Can't decode real Ethereum data (blocks, transactions, etc.)
- Makes decoder completely unusable for production

**How Found**:  
- Ran RLP decode validation against Ethereum tests
- Immediate panic on first nested list

**Status**: FOUND, NOT FIXED  
**Priority**: P0 - Blocks all further validation  
**Fix ETA**: Must fix today

##  High Priority Bugs

### Bug #2: RLP Encoder Doesn't Support Large Integers
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Found**: October 29, 2025  
**Location**: `src/rlp/rlp.zig` - `encodeU64` function

**Impact**:
- Can only encode integers up to 2^64
- Can't encode large balances, values, gas limits
- Not suitable for real Ethereum data

**Workaround**: Validator has big int parsing  
**Status**: WORKAROUND ONLY  
**Priority**: P1  
**Fix ETA**: 2-3 days

##  Validation-Discovered Issues

| Bug # | Component | Severity | Status | Found When |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| #1 | RLP Decoder | CRITICAL | Found | Decode validation |
| #2 | RLP Encoder | HIGH | Workaround | Encode validation |

##  What This Teaches Us

### Before Validation:
- "RLP works! 100% of OUR tests pass!"
- Confidence: High
- Reality: False confidence

### After Validation:
- "RLP encoder: 100% Ethereum validated "
- "RLP decoder: PANICS on nested lists "
- "Large integers: Not supported "
- Confidence: Accurate
- Reality: Known

##  Why This Process Is Critical

**We found these bugs BEFORE launch.**

If we had launched yesterday:
- Users try to decode Ethereum blocks → CRASH
- Users try to encode large values → FAIL
- We look incompetent

**Instead**:
- We found the bugs ourselves
- We're fixing them systematically
- We'll launch with proof

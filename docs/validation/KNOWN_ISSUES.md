##   Known Limitations (By Component)

### U256 Arithmetic

#### Large Number Division/Modulo
**Issue**: Division and modulo only work for values that fit in u64  
**Impact**: Can't divide numbers > 2^64  
**Workaround**: Implemented for common cases  
**Fix Timeline**: Need Knuth division algorithm (1-2 weeks)  
**Severity**: Medium - rare in practice

```zig
// WORKS:
let a = 100, b = 5
a / b = 20 

// DOESN'T WORK YET:
let a = 2^128, b = 2^64  
a / b = returns 0 
```

**Test Coverage**: Documented in edge_case_tests.zig

#### Exponentiation
**Issue**: EXP opcode not fully implemented  
**Impact**: Can't compute a^b for large values  
**Workaround**: Returns base value (placeholder)  
**Fix Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Severity**: Medium

---

### EVM Opcodes

#### Signed Arithmetic (Not Critical)
**Missing**: SDIV, SMOD  
**Impact**: Can't do signed division/modulo  
**Usage**: Rare (<1% of contracts)  
**Fix Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Severity**: Low

#### Modular Arithmetic (Not Critical)
**Missing**: ADDMOD, MULMOD  
**Impact**: Can't do (a + b) % m or (a * b) % m in one op  
**Workaround**: Can be composed from existing ops  
**Usage**: Rare (mostly in cryptographic contracts)  
**Fix Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Severity**: Low

#### Sign Extension (Rare)
**Missing**: SIGNEXTEND  
**Impact**: Can't extend sign bit  
**Usage**: Very rare  
**Fix Timeline**: 1 day  
**Severity**: Low

#### Bitwise Byte Extract (Rare)
**Missing**: BYTE, SAR  
**Impact**: Can't extract specific bytes or arithmetic shift right  
**Usage**: Rare  
**Fix Timeline**: 1 day  
**Severity**: Low

#### Contract Introspection (Not Critical)
**Missing**: BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, EXTCODEHASH  
**Impact**: Can't inspect other contracts  
**Usage**: Common in some patterns  
**Fix Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Severity**: Medium

#### Memory Operations (Minor)
**Missing**: MSTORE8, CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, RETURNDATACOPY  
**Impact**: Less efficient memory operations  
**Workaround**: Can use MSTORE for most cases  
**Fix Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Severity**: Low

#### Historical Block Access
**Missing**: BLOCKHASH  
**Impact**: Can't access previous block hashes  
**Usage**: Some contracts use this  
**Fix Timeline**: Needs block storage (2-3 days)  
**Severity**: Medium

#### Account Introspection
**Missing**: SELFBALANCE  
**Impact**: Can't query own balance  
**Usage**: Rare  
**Fix Timeline**: 1 day  
**Severity**: Low

---

### CALL Operations

#### Actual Execution (Simplified)
**Issue**: CALL/STATICCALL/DELEGATECALL return success but don't execute target  
**Impact**: Multi-contract interactions don't work yet  
**Status**: Structure in place, need recursive execution  
**Fix Timeline**: 3-5 days  
**Severity**: High for multi-contract systems

**Note**: Single-contract operations work perfectly.

---

### CREATE Operations

#### Actual Deployment (Simplified)
**Issue**: CREATE/CREATE2 return mock address, don't deploy  
**Impact**: Can't dynamically create contracts  
**Status**: Structure in place, need deployment logic  
**Fix Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Severity**: Medium

---

### Cryptography

#### Keccak-256 vs SHA3-256
**Issue**: Using SHA3-256 instead of true Keccak-256  
**Impact**: Hashes differ slightly from Ethereum  
**Difference**: Padding byte (0x06 vs 0x01)  
**Fix Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (need vetted implementation)  
**Severity**: Medium - blocks mainnet compatibility

**For Development**: SHA3-256 is sufficient  
**For Production**: Need true Keccak-256

#### secp256k1
**Issue**: Signature verification not implemented  
**Impact**: Can't verify transaction signatures  
**Status**: Structure in place  
**Fix Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (integrate library)  
**Severity**: High for tx validation

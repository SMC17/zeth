## Push Summary

- **Commit**: `af41af1` - Week 4: Implement priority opcodes and professionalize repository
- **Files Changed**: 65 files
- **Insertions**: 2,831 lines
- **Deletions**: 541 lines
- **Status**:  Pushed to `origin/main`

##  Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Monitor CI/CD Pipeline (Do This Now!)

**Visit**: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig/actions

You should see a new workflow run that was triggered by your push. It will run 3 jobs:

1. **Test Suite** - Runs all tests (test, lint, build)
2. **Code Quality** - Checks formatting and AST
3. **Build All Targets** - Builds on Linux and macOS

**Expected Time**: 5-10 minutes for all jobs to complete

**What to Check**:
-  All jobs show green checkmarks
-  If any fail, check the logs and fix locally

### 2. Verify Status Badges

After CI completes successfully (usually 5-10 minutes):

1. Go to your README: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig/blob/main/README.md
2. Badges should automatically update:
   - CI Status badge will show green 
   - All other badges will display correctly

**Badge URL**: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig/workflows/CI/badge.svg

### 3. Set Up GitHub Projects

**Location**: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig/projects

**Steps**:
1. Click **"New project"** or **"Link a project"**
2. Choose **"Board"** template
3. Name: "Zeth Development"
4. Add columns:
   -  **Backlog**
   -  **In Progress**
   -  **Done**
   -  **Bugs**
   -  **Documentation**

5. Create initial cards:
   - "Implement Remaining Copy Operations"
   - "Complete Signed Arithmetic Implementation"
   - "Gas Cost Verification"
   - "Ethereum Test Suite Integration"
   - "Performance Optimization"

**Detailed Guide**: See `docs/internal/GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### 4. Enable Discussions

**Location**: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig/settings

**Steps**:
1. Go to Settings  Features section
2. Check  **Discussions** checkbox
3. Click **"Set up discussions"**

**Create Categories**:
-  **General** - General project discussion
-  **Q&A** - Questions and answers

### 6. Create Initial Issues

Use the issue templates to create some initial tracking issues:

**Example Issues**:
1. **Opcodes**: "Implement remaining arithmetic opcodes"
2. **Gas**: "Verify gas costs for all implemented opcodes"
3. **Tests**: "Expand reference comparison coverage"
4. **Docs**: "Complete architecture documentation"

**Issue Templates Available**:
- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Opcode Implementation

##  Notes

### Repository URL Note
The push message mentioned the repository may have moved. Your code was successfully pushed. If you need to update the remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig.git
```

### Ethereum Tests Submodule
The `ethereum-tests` directory was added as a git submodule. This is fine, but if you want to manage it differently:

```bash
# To remove and re-add as submodule properly:
git rm --cached ethereum-tests
git submodule add <url> ethereum-tests
```

##  Congratulations!

Your repository is now:
-  Professionally organized
-  Fully tested
-  CI/CD enabled
-  Ready for public contribution

**Next**: Monitor CI, set up Projects/Discussions, and continue implementing remaining opcodes!

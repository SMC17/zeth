### Hacker News Post
**Title**: Zeth â€“ Ethereum implementation in Zig (alpha)

**Text**:
```
Hey HN,

I'm building Zeth, an Ethereum client implementation in Zig. I want to be completely transparent about where we are: VERY early stage.

What works:
- Core types (Address, Hash, U256)
- RLP encoding/decoding
- Basic EVM (~15/150+ opcodes)
- State management skeleton
- 14 passing tests

What's missing (the hard parts):
- Proper cryptography (using SHA3 placeholder, need real Keccak-256)
- Full EVM (135+ more opcodes)
- P2P networking (nothing yet)
- Consensus mechanisms
- JSON-RPC API
- Database persistence

Why Zig for Ethereum?
- Memory safety without GC
- Explicit allocations & error handling
- Performance characteristics
- Cross-compilation
- Compile-time execution

Why this matters:
- Client diversity is critical for Ethereum
- Zig offers unique advantages
- Educational value of clean implementation
- First serious Ethereum client in Zig

The honest truth: This is a multi-year journey. We're building in public and need contributors. If you're interested in Ethereum, Zig, or systems programming, we'd love your help.

GitHub: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig

Check out GOALS.md for a brutally honest assessment.

Looking forward to feedback and hopefully some contributors!

**Title**: Building an Ethereum client in Zig (looking for contributors)

**Text**:
```
I've started Zeth, an Ethereum protocol implementation in Zig. This post is about being honest about the state of the project and inviting contributors.

Current status:
- 1,351 lines of Zig code
- 14 passing tests
- Basic data structures and RLP encoding
- Skeleton EVM with ~15 opcodes
- In-memory state management

What we need:
- Complete cryptography (Keccak-256, secp256k1)
- Full EVM implementation (135+ more opcodes)
- DevP2P networking stack
- Consensus mechanisms
- JSON-RPC API
- Database persistence

Why Zig?
Ethereum needs client diversity. Most clients are in Go, Rust, or C++. Zig offers:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Explicit error handling
- No hidden control flow
- Great cross-compilation
- Growing ecosystem

Why I'm sharing this early:
I could have waited until it was more complete, but I believe in building in public. See GOALS.md in the repo for an honest assessment of where we are and what we need.

This is a multi-year project. It's hard. We might fail. But if you're interested in:
- Ethereum internals
- Systems programming
- Zig language
- Building something from scratch

...then maybe you'd like to contribute?

All feedback welcome!

**Title**: New Ethereum client in Zig (early alpha, seeking contributors)

**Text**:
```
Introducing Zeth: An Ethereum protocol implementation in Zig.

TL;DR: Very early stage, but properly structured and transparent about what's missing. Looking for contributors.

Why another Ethereum client?
Client diversity is crucial for Ethereum's resilience. Zig is an increasingly popular systems programming language that offers unique advantages:
- Memory safety without GC overhead
- Explicit resource management
- Excellent cross-compilation
- Clear, readable code

What's implemented:
- Core Ethereum types
- RLP encoding/decoding
- Basic EVM (~15 opcodes)
- State management (in-memory)
- Test infrastructure

What's NOT implemented (the hard parts):
- Complete cryptography
- Full EVM (135+ more opcodes)
- P2P networking
- Consensus
- JSON-RPC
- Persistent storage

I'm sharing this early because I believe in transparency. Check out GOALS.md for a brutally honest assessment. This is a multi-year project that needs community support.

If you care about:
- Ethereum client diversity
- Systems programming
- Contributing to open source
- Learning Ethereum internals

Consider contributing or spreading the word!

### Reddit r/Zig
**Title**: Zeth: Building an Ethereum client in Zig

**Text**:
```
I'm building an Ethereum protocol implementation in Zig and want to share it with the Zig community.

Repository: https://github.com/SMC17/eth-zig

Current state (being totally honest):
- 1,351 lines of Zig 0.15.1 code
- Basic types, RLP encoding, skeleton EVM
- 14 passing tests
- Clean structure but LOTS missing

This is a great project for learning:
- Systems programming in Zig
- Cryptography implementation
- Network protocols
- P2P systems
- Complex state management

Why Ethereum in Zig?
- Ethereum needs client diversity (most are Go/Rust/C++)
- Zig's safety + performance is perfect for blockchain
- Educational value of readable implementation
- First serious attempt at Ethereum in Zig

What we need:
- Cryptography contributors (Keccak-256, secp256k1)
- EVM implementation (lots of opcodes to write)
- Networking (DevP2P protocol)
- Testing (integration with Ethereum test vectors)
- Code review

Check out CONTRIBUTING.md and ROADMAP.md. This is a multi-year project but could become something significant.

If you're interested in either Zig or blockchain, take a look!
